# Example showing that EVM contract can be updated


The `contracts/EVM.cdc` file was modified adding a TODO comment

```
go run main.go
üìú deploy contracts EVM
Look for a TODO comment at the start of the following output
======
‚≠ê Script  run result:"import Crypto\nimport FlowToken from 0x0ae53cb6e3f42a79\naccess(all)\ncontract EVM {\n\n    //TODO: this is an update
```
